# Task completion and status change in HubSpot CRM

This example demonstrates how to use the HubSpot CRM Tasks connector to check the status of a task assigned to a specific owner. It first retrieves the task details based on the task ID and checks its current status. If the status is not "Completed," the task owner updates it to "Completed." This process allows task owners to manage and track their tasks effectively, ensuring tasks are marked as completed when done, directly from the HubSpot CRM.

## Prerequisites

1. Generate HubSpot credentials to authenticate the connector as described in the [Setup guide](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-hubspot.crm.engagements.tasks/blob/main/ballerina/Package.md#setup-guide).

2. For each example, create a `Config.toml` file the related configuration. Here's an example of how your `Config.toml` file should look:

    ```toml
    clientId = <Client Id>
    clientSecret = <Client Secret>
    refreshToken = <Refresh Token>
    ```

## Running an example

Execute the following commands to build an example from the source:

* To build an example:

    ```bash
    bal build
    ```

* To run an example:

    ```bash
    bal run
    ```

## Building the examples with the local module

**Warning**: Due to the absence of support for reading local repositories for single Ballerina files, the Bala of the module is manually written to the central repository as a workaround. Consequently, the bash script may modify your local Ballerina repositories.

Execute the following commands to build all the examples against the changes you have made to the module locally:

* To build all the examples:

    ```bash
    ./build.sh build
    ```

* To run all the examples:

    ```bash
    ./build.sh run
    ```
